An AI bot designed to assist admins with massive communities. Can create bash shells and manage the computer or server from which the bot is run. 
Uses a natural-language AI to remove the need for CLI; Penny (the name of the bot) functions based only on normal text-based messages.
Work in progress, excuse any bugs you may find.
