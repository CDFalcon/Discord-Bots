This bot was my latest public creation. A commission from TAG Esports for their discord, its goal is to create smaller Discord Hubs for other servers to come and advertise on. Only thing remotely worth mentioning is how lazy I was making this; notice how I elected to use a database of channel ID's for passwords instead of a SQL/JSON/Text database. Whatever, you may find something interesting in here.
